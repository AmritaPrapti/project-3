        <h2>About Cresicor</h2>
        <p>Cresicor is a promotion management (TPM) software built by and for people in the consumer packaged goods (CPG) industry. We provide a range of services and solutions in strategy, consulting, technology, and reporting. We are designed to fit the quintessential business model of smaller natural CPG companies that typically rely on indirect business models.

           <br> Historically, the CPG industry has experimented with several solutions to TPM. As the complexity of trade has risen, the need for process improvements has also increased. Spreadsheets no longer deliver the clean and concise information needed to support trade promotion decision-making. To achieve optimal growth, trade spend needs to be viewed as a series of thoughtful, purposeful investments, not just the cost of doing business. </p>
